🖥️ Basic Keylogger in Python
⚠️ For Educational and Ethical Use Only

This project demonstrates how to create a simple keylogger in Python. It listens to keyboard inputs and logs the keys into a text file.

This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes and must not be used to violate privacy or without consent.

📚 How It Works
Uses the pynput library to monitor keyboard activity.

Captures and logs every key press.

Stores logged keys into a .txt file (e.g., key_log.txt).

🚀 Features
Logs keystrokes in real-time

Writes logs to a file

Cross-platform (works on Windows, Linux, Mac)
